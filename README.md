# JavaScript-Text-Adventure-Game
This is a project done to fulfill requirements for JavaScript for Beginners course by CodeSmith.
I and my team members wrote the code, I specifically contibuted to the Scientist part of the game, the skeletal framework and worked
together with the team to put it all together.
